### Towers of Hanoi

[Live](https://terencechiu.me/towers-of-hanoi/)

This is a simple implementation of [Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi), built using React and the ```react-dnd``` library.

To play, players simply drag and drop the disks to move them. When the game is won (all disks are on second or third tower), the player will be notified via a modal and have the option to replay the game.

### Running the app

In the project directory, run ```npm start``` to open the app in development mode, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
